<b>CSI 140 - Front-End Web Development 5 Credits</b>
Students will learn the basic elements defined in the HTML language to initially 
build simple web pages and forms, then adding semantics, structures, and more 
sophisticated forms using HTML5 elements. In the second part of 
this course, students will add styles 
to their web pages and forms using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). In the final project, students 
should be able to design quality web pages as rated by professionals. 
<p>
<b>CSI 130 - Database Design 5 Credits</b>
This is an introductory course for the student with little or no experience designing
 and building relational databases. The students learn the basics of relational database
  theory and rules of normalization, and how to incorporate business requirements into the 
  design for a database. They also learn to use a program or language such as Structured Query
   Language (SQL) to create basic database objects and to manipulate data. 
</p>

<p>
<b>CSI 234 - Applied Database Development 5 Credits</b>
This course is designed for the student who is already familiar with basic relational database theory.
 The focus of this course is databases in the n-tier client/server development model. Students learn 
 and utilize more advanced program or language topics, such as enterprise-level objects, views
 , stored procedures, functions, indexes, constraints, transaction handling, and triggers in 
 event-driven database applications. Additionally, the class covers best practices in
  administration, user management and security, including effective planning for updates,
   backup, and disaster recovery.Prerequisite(s): CSI 130

<p>
<b>CSI 120 - Computer Programming I 5 Credits</b>
This course introduces the basics of computer programming and problem solving. Students will develop skills in designing and writing simple computer programs in an integrated programming environment (IDE). Topics include flowchart concepts, language syntax, data types and operators, methods, control structures such as conditionals and loops, and arrays.
</p>
<p>
<b>CSI 122 - Computer Programming II 5 Credits </b>
Students write creative programs demonstrating skill in structured design and code, using decision and iteration structures, as well as effective documentation. Students learn to write event-driven applications using forms, controls, properties and methods.

Prerequisite(s): CSI 120 
</p>

<p>
    <b>CSI 124 - Computer Programming III 5 Credits </b>
Students are introduced to the concepts of object-oriented programming. Students learn to write applications using structures, classes, interfaces, inheritance and polymorphism. In addition, students learn to use and create delegates, events, collections, exceptions, dynamic link libraries and input/output streams to build real-world applications.

Prerequisite(s): CSI 122 
</p>

<p>
<b>CSI 226 - Computer Programming IV 5 Credits</b>
In this advanced programming course, students continue refining their coding skills in topics such as polymorphism, encapsulation, asynchronous programming, multi-threaded applications, and distributed applications.

Prerequisite(s): CSI 124
